# 3DTetris
A 3D Tetris game for Kokku's Junior Developer recruitment process using Unity Engine 2020.1.3.f1

Inspirated by [JEON SOYEON Jelly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ8kJdTYj1o) that I was listening when I started this!

## Final considerations
A 3D Tetris was way harder than I expected, I had to review a lot about grids and tried out Shader programming a little bit. The mainly Tetris mechanic is based on a grid with two dimensions that will constantly verify the position of all cubes of a Tetris Piece, witch you ensure that the shape doesn't matter for the code. Although I didn't get the Jelly effect I wanted (from NVIDIA FleX Soft Body) and couldn't construct illumination right, I'm pretty happy with the outcome. 

## Next steps
- Build illumination
- Develop a good Jelly effect on the cubes
- Fix a little bug from the piece movement
- Make the piece speed editable by the user
- Enable optios like:
	- Sound On/Off;
	- Show indicator of the piece's final position; 
	- Bonus per row On/Off;
	- Levels of difficulty; 

### Thank you for the opportunity Kokku!
